# 🚀 Cosmic Lens Lite
**A Production-Grade NASA APOD Explorer built with Flutter & Provider**

---

## 📖 Project Overview

**Cosmic Lens Lite** is a robust mobile application designed to explore the cosmos using the **NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API**.

Unlike simple tutorial apps, this project was architected to demonstrate **production-grade engineering principles**. It features robust state management, defensive handling of complex API data (polymorphic media types), intelligent local caching for network efficiency, and a cross-platform responsive design that works seamlessly on both Mobile and Web.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Core Functionality**
* **Daily Astronomy Feed:** Fetches and displays high-resolution images and detailed scientific explanations from NASA's live API.
* **Time Travel Mode:** Users can query specific historical dates using a native Date Picker to view past astronomical events (e.g., birthdays, historic launches).
* **Swipe Navigation:** "Tinder-style" gesture navigation allows users to intuitively swipe left/right to browse through previous and next days seamlessly.

### 2. **Advanced Media Handling**
* **Polymorphic Data Support:** The app intelligently detects the `media_type` returned by the API.
    * **Images:** Rendered with `CachedNetworkImage` for performance and offline capability.
    * **Videos:** Handled via a custom "Watch Video" interface that deep-links to YouTube/Vimeo using `url_launcher`, preventing crashes on video-only days.

### 3. **Performance & Optimization**
* **Smart In-Memory Caching:** Implements a HashMap-based caching strategy (`Map<String, ApodModel>`). Once a date is fetched, it is stored locally, ensuring **instant load times (0ms)** and zero network cost when swiping back to previously viewed days.
* **Pull-to-Refresh:** Users can pull down to instantly reset the application state to "Today," clearing temporary navigation history.

### 4. **UI/UX & Responsiveness**
* **Cross-Platform Responsive Design:**
    * **Mobile:** Uses native `ListView` and flexible widgets for a perfect fit on all screen sizes.
    * **Web:** Implements a `ConstrainedBox` architecture (`maxWidth: 600px`) to maintain a clean, mobile-app-like experience on desktop browsers without awkward stretching.
* **Defensive UI:** Graceful handling of missing API data (null safety) ensures users never see technical error messages.
* **Premium Splash Screen:** Features a custom "Breathing" animation (Fade + Scale) for a polished app launch experience.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

The project follows a strict **Layered Architecture** to ensure maintainability and scalability.

### **1. Data Layer (`lib/models`, `lib/services`)**
* **Robust Models:** `ApodModel` includes defensive `fromJson` parsing logic to handle null values gracefully (e.g., missing copyright info) and normalize data types.
* **Service Isolation:** `ApiService` abstracts all HTTP logic, endpoint construction, and exception handling from the rest of the app.

### **2. State Management (`lib/providers`)**
* **Provider Pattern:** Uses `ChangeNotifier` to manage global application state.
* **Logic Flow:** The Provider handles the business logic for:
    * Fetching data.
    * Managing the cache.
    * Updating `isLoading` and `errorMessage` states.
    * Notifying the UI only when necessary to minimize rebuilds.

### **3. UI Layer (`lib/screens`)**
* **Passive Views:** Screens are "dumb" widgets that simply consume data from the Provider.
* **Gesture Logic:** Complex interaction logic (Swipe detection) is handled directly in the UI layer to control navigation intent before passing requests to the Provider.

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Dependencies

* **Framework:** Flutter (Dart)
* **State Management:** `provider` (v6.x)
* **Networking:** `http`
* **APIs:** [NASA APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov/)
* **Key Packages:**
    * `cached_network_image`: For efficient image rendering and caching.
    * `url_launcher`: For handling external video links securely.
    * `intl`: For precise date formatting (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
    * `google_fonts`: For themed typography (Orbitron).

## 💡 Engineering Decisions (Interview Talking Points)

1.  **Why Provider?**
    * Chosen for its lightweight footprint and ease of testing compared to heavier solutions like BLoC, while still offering excellent separation of business logic for this scale of application.

2.  **The "Video Trap" Solution:**
    * Recognized that NASA's API returns different JSON structures for videos. Implemented a `media_type` check in the Model layer to branch UI logic, ensuring 100% stability.

3.  **Web Constraint Strategy:**
    * Instead of maintaining two codebases, I applied a `max-width` constraint strategy. This is a standard industry pattern (used by Instagram/Twitter) to deliver a consistent mobile-first experience on desktop.
